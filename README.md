Hello,
  
You will see a total of 5 files.
These files are as follows:
MathOP.java
MathOP.class
MathOP2.java
MathOP2.class.
README.txt -- which is instructions on how to use the ifle.
  
Please extract these files in the file path of where Java is seen.

MATHOP - stores all of the methods, and attributes to perform a calculation.

MATHOP2 - stores the object class Calc() to call the constructor or method in the MATHOP file.

The MATHOP2 file is the main file that should be ran.

--HOW TO COMPILE YOUR CODE/FILE?---------------------------------------------

Before you run your file please compile both the MATHOP.java and MATHOP2.java.

To compile your code :
You can compile from within the IDE example: JGRASP > BUILD >COMPILE
OR From CMD (Command Prompt) type in : javac filename.(MATHOP2 file may compile the class as Calc.class. not sure why, but FYI I had to rename the file in the filepath.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once both files are compiled please run the MATHOP2.java file as the main file.


WHATS NEW?

This week we are incorporating the write and read method of a file where the user input is saved in a file and read to the console.

When you run MathOP2.java. The console will ask you for your name. Please enter your name.

The MathOP2.java has new code added to it after you enter your name you should see a System.out.printf() statement greeting to print back the user's name after user input.

Since there is already code to ask for two numbers for each operation. The MATHOP2.java file will proceed callling on each operation.

Please follow the instructions in the console as soon as two numbers are input and saved, you can open the file to see the values stored in .CSV. The console will output the values stored in the file. This will occur for each method.

The MathOP.java file are where all of the operation/methods/variables are stored along with a try and catch to catch any exception errors that are thrown.


Instructions: Run the MATHOP2.java file and follow the prompts in the console.
